# Youtube-Tutorial
This code was taken from a YouTube tutorial from the Dreaded Dev channel (unfortunately no longer exsists). This is my first experience with HTML and CSS and the final product was slightly different than that of the original creator. This project takes three images and gives them a hover effect when the user hovers the cursor over the images.
